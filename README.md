# Air-Trafic-Control-System

This air traffic control is a web application to be used at airports to control the landing & takeoff of flights at a particular airport to avoid delay in flights.
The application is designed to be used by a ATC officer.
On the UI there is input table where ATC officers is supposed to enter the details of flight in vicinity of airport.

##Features:

1) Helps landing flight based on remaining fuel.
2) Considers case of emergency landing.
3) Considers space available in a particular airport.
4) considers vacancy of runways available at every moment.
5) utilises space of nearby extensions for managing flight traffic in case of crowd & for emergency.
6) calculates fuel elapsed in landing flight.
7) displays tabular data about each flight that which flight should land at which terminal.
8) give real time status of each terminal of airport on notification panel.

9) predicts whether a flight is delayed or not after it is landed using machine learning.
10) this prediction tells the efficiency of air traffic control system, that whether is capable of reducing delays in flights or not.


##Details to be entered:

1) Flight no.
2) available fuel/ remaining fuel
3) whether it requires emergency landing

##Assumptions taken for demonstration:

1) every flight landed successfully would takeoff after 10 sec of landing.
2) fuel required to travel per km
3) no. of runways & terminals in a airport

## How to run the Web application

Simply put all the above file in a folder named "ATC" and open the html file.
